# EthansCatchupProjectsIdea
Hey Pete, have you thought of coming up with a different app that's similar to 14 or 13 and doing a series of catch up meetings where you build the project together as the group, and you could record them and have them accessible for future catch up guys? I was just thinking about that figured I'd mention


## Is this practice reps for the Final Project?

Hey! Good guess! Pretty much everything we do here would be usable (skills wise) on the final project.

## Main Stuff

- [Main Easiest Project](docs/1_EASIEST_POSSIBLE.md)
- [Shared Resources](docs/00_RESOURCES_SHARED.md)
- [High Level Objectives](docs/0_ANCILLARY_OBJECTIVES.md)

## Then, if we get the Main Easiest Project done, and want more reps:

- [Adding a join table](docs/2_ADD_SECOND_TABLE.md)
- [Adding JPA](docs/3_ADD_JPA.md)
- [Adding User Registration](docs/4_ADD_USER_REGISTRATION.md)
- [Adding Spring Security](docs/5_ADD_SPRING_SECURITY.md)
